# Michiel van der Ree's homepage
I am a machine learning engineer (or "digital methodologist"[^1]) with [team Data Science](http://datascience.web.rug.nl) of the Center of Information Technology, University of Groningen. At a general level, my work is about developing data-driven approximators to steps in the scientific workflow. I focus mainly on applications of natural language processing.

Interested in collaborating? Feel free to contact me at `michiel.van.der.ree[at]rug.nl`.
