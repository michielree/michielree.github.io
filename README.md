# Michiel van der Ree's homepage
I am a machine learning engineer (or "digital methodologist"[^1]) with the Center of Information Technology of the University of Groningen. At a general level, my work is about developing data-driven approximators to steps in the scientific workflow. Recently my focus has been on applications of natural language processing.

Interested in collaborating? Feel free to contact me at `michiel.van.der.ree[at]rug.nl`.
